# Todoey
One of the projects we worked on while learning iOSDev (instructed by Angela Yu on Udemy.com). The goal of this project is to familiarise us with CoreData, Realm, UserDefaults, playing around with TableViews &amp; Cells, ... .   

# SIGH... I inadvertently deleted the project. Nevertheless, this repo will not be deleted.
